# ES5 Deprecation

Once we decide we want to move to ES6 entirely, complete the
tasks below during the deprecation process:

* in `package.json`, main should be changed from `dist/index.js` to
  `lib/index.js`
* remove the babel dev-dependencies in `package.json`
* remove the unnecessary scripts in `package.json`
* scan comments with `ES5: ` in the following files:
    * `.gitignore`
    * `.npmignore`
    * `Gruntfile.js`
* remove `.babelrc` file
* remove support for the 0.x Node series in `.travis.yml`
* remove this file entirely
